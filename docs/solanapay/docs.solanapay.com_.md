## How to use Solana Pay

### Accept payments in your web app

Use the [`@solana/pay` JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/tree/master/core) to start accepting payments in your app today.

### Accept payments in person

Run the open-source [Solana Pay Point of Sale app](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/tree/master/examples/point-of-sale) to start accepting payments in-person.

## Getting Involved

Solana Pay is an open standard to facilitate commerce on Solana. We are looking for more contributors to help develop the ecosystem. Here are a few ideas if you're looking to get involved.

### Hackathon Projects

The [Solana Grizzlython Hackathon](https://solana.com/grizzlython) is happening right now. There's a dedicated Payments track, presented by Stripe.

Here are some [Solana Pay hackathon ideas](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1070574785723157359) to get started thinking about how you can build the future of payments.

### eCommerce Platform Integrations

To get as many merchants accepting payments on Solana as possible we need to provide easy ways to set up Solana Pay on all eCommerce platforms.

Solana Labs has started a reference implementation for Shopify which you can see [here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/blob/shopify/shopify) to get a sense of how this might work.

Here are some of the top eCommerce platforms that we're looking to integrate to:

- WooCommerce
- Magento
- BigCommerce
- Wix
- Squarespace

### Other possible projects

- Mobile SDKs
- Checkout UX Components

Do you have another idea? Feel free to open an issue to discuss it with the community.

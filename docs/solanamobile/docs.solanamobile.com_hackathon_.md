# Solana Mobile Hackathon

Get ready Solana Mobile Developers!

Notify Me

## What is it?

In July, Solana Mobile will be launching its very first hackathon — the **Solana Mobile Hackathon** — focused on creating brand new mobile Solana dApps OR converting existing Solana dApps to mobile for submission to the Solana dApp Store.

## What's the goal?

The future of crypto is mobile, and Solana Mobile and Seeker offer a unique opportunity for developers to access 170,000+ native Solana devices from day one of launch. We want to make sure the mobile dApp store is filled with some of the best and most unique experiences in crypto. Whether you're starting with a fresh idea or pivoting your existing Solana web app to mobile, we want you to build for a mobile future!

## What's the opportunity?

First and foremost we believe that being a first mover into a platform with so many native Solana users from day one provides a unique and BIG opportunity for new projects looking for distribution. Instead of fighting for attention on social media amongst thousands of blockchains and apps, you're only competing against a small set of first movers who build for mobile — and to a userbase of power users eager to be first in line for new onchain experiences.

…But that's not all. Did we mention **PRIZES**?

While full details are still being worked out, **we are looking to offer a variety of prize types:**

- Marketing and launch support
- Cash prizes
- Seeker devices
- Special track prizes
- Highlighted or featured dApp store placement

All of the above is subject to change until official details have gone live.

We look forward to building the future of mobile **ON SOLANA** with you!

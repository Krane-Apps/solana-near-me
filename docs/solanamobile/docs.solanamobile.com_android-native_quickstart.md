The quickest way to start building Solana Kotlin dApps is to build off the [Solana Jetpack Compose Scaffold](https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-kotlin-compose-scaffold).

## Solana Jetpack Compose Scaffold [‚Äã](https://docs.solanamobile.com/android-native/quickstart\#solana-jetpack-compose-scaffold "Direct link to Solana Jetpack Compose Scaffold")

The scaffold app serves as both a starting implementation and an example reference of how to use the core Kotlin SDKs, like `web3-core`, `rpc-core`,
and Mobile Wallet Adapter.

It includes:

- Core Solana kotlin libraries
- Pre-built Compose UI components,
- Code examples of transaction building and RPC requests.

## Prerequisites [‚Äã](https://docs.solanamobile.com/android-native/quickstart\#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Follow the [prerequisite setup](https://docs.solanamobile.com/developers/development-setup#prerequisite-setup) guide to set up Android Studio, your [Android Device/Emulator](https://docs.solanamobile.com/developers/development-setup#2-setup-deviceemulator) and install a MWA-compatible wallet, like [fakewallet](https://docs.solanamobile.com/developers/development-setup#3-install-a-wallet-app).

## Install the Jetpack Compose Scaffold [‚Äã](https://docs.solanamobile.com/android-native/quickstart\#install-the-jetpack-compose-scaffold "Direct link to Install the Jetpack Compose Scaffold")

**Clone the repo**

The scaffold app is open source and can be fetched from [Github](https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-kotlin-compose-scaffold).

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
git clone https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-kotlin-compose-scaffold.git

```

**Open the project in Android Studio**

In Android Studio, open the project with `File > Open > SolanaKotlinComposeScaffold/build.gradle.kts`

**Build and run**

Ensure you have connected an Android emulator or device and it is detected by Android Studio. If not, follow
this [guide](https://docs.solanamobile.com/developers/development-setup#2-setup-deviceemulator) to setup your emulator/device.

In the top bar of Android Studio, select `"app"` as the configuration and your emulator/device, then click run.

![Build and run the app](https://docs.solanamobile.com/assets/images/compose-build-run-953a48b83f21f65098b34cb964f6e008.png)

If successful, the scaffold app will launch on your emulator/device.

Connect with a locally installed wallet app to start interacting with the Solana network! üéâ

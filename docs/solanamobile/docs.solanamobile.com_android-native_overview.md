Kotlin is an [officially supported](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) programming language for Android development and is used to build native Android apps.

This section of the site provides a developer guide for building Kotlin Android apps for Solana.

## Benefits of native Android development [‚Äã](https://docs.solanamobile.com/android-native/overview\#benefits-of-native-android-development "Direct link to Benefits of native Android development")

### Direct access to Android OS features [‚Äã](https://docs.solanamobile.com/android-native/overview\#direct-access-to-android-os-features "Direct link to Direct access to Android OS features")

Developing on Android enables convenient and full access to the Android platform's capabilities. Developers can access OS-specific functionalities like Camera SDK, ARKit, Touch ID, hardware sensors, etc without needing any bridging.

### Optimized performance [‚Äã](https://docs.solanamobile.com/android-native/overview\#optimized-performance "Direct link to Optimized performance")

Native Android apps, as a result of full utilization of the system capabilities, generally have better performance and efficiency. Native apps provide the highest attainable frame rates, computing power, graphics support, etc.

### Jetpack Compose [‚Äã](https://docs.solanamobile.com/android-native/overview\#jetpack-compose "Direct link to Jetpack Compose")

Kotlin enables the building of Android apps using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/why-adopt), a modern toolkit for creating native Android UIs. The Kotlin sample apps
on this documentation site are all built with Jetpack Compose.

### Solana dApp Store [​](https://docs.solanamobile.com/additional-sdks/dapp_store_intro\#solana-dapp-store "Direct link to Solana dApp Store")

The Solana dApp Store is an alternate app distribution system, well suited to distributing apps developed by the Solana ecosystem. It will provide a distribution channel for apps that want to establish direct relationships with their customers, without other app stores’ rules restricting the relationship or seeking a large revenue share. The goal of the Solana dApp Store is to empower the Solana community to eventually play a key role in managing the contents of this app store.

For app developers, we will be updating this SDK to include publishing tools and instructions for preparing and submitting your apps for inclusion in the Solana dApp Store catalog. Watch this space for future developments!
